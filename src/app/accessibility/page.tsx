            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Welcome to Nier Transportation&#39;s Accessibility Policy. We are
              committed to making our website accessible to all individuals,
              including those with disabilities. This policy outlines our
              efforts to ensure that our website is accessible and usable to the
              widest possible audience.

            <h2>2. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</h2>
            <p>
              We strive to comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
              (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA, a globally recognized standard for web
              accessibility. Our efforts include:
              <br />
              <br />
              - Providing alternative text descriptions for non-text content,
              such as images and multimedia.
              <br />
              <br />- Ensuring that our website is navigable using keyboard-only
              or screen-reader technology.
              <br />
              <br />- Using adaptable and responsive design principles to
              accommodate various devices and screen sizes.
              <br />
              <br />- Offering clear and consistent navigation and structure
              throughout the website.

              such as screen readers and voice recognition software. Users who
              rely on these tools should be able to access and interact with our
              website with ease.
