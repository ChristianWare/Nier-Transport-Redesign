The Fiesta Bowl is renowned for its tradition of hosting high-stakes, thrilling matchups that often become instant classics in college football history. This year’s game is even more special, as it marks the beginning of the new CFP Quarterfinal format.

In this expanded playoff structure, the Fiesta Bowl will feature one of the top four conference champions—teams that receive a first-round bye—against the winner of a first-round game between seeds five through twelve. Fans eagerly awaiting the lineup won’t have to wait long; the participating teams will be announced on Sunday, December 8, 2024.
